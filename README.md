# Agent_Based_Stock_Trading

**Project Title:**  Developing an Automated Stock Trading System with Deep Evolution Strategy and Neural Networks

**Project Description:** This project demonstrates the construction of an automated stock trading agent that utilizes a neural network optimized by the Deep Evolution Strategy (DES) algorithm. The agent learns to make trading decisions based on historical stock data, showcasing the potential of advanced algorithms in financial markets.

**My Approach:**

 - Data handling and visualization: Employed pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation and matplotlib/seaborn for insightful visualizations.
 - Neural network model: Built a neural network to predict stock price movements.
 - Deep Evolution Strategy (DES): Implemented DES to optimize the neural network's weights, bypassing the need for gradient calculations.
 - Automated trading agent: Developed an intelligent agent that uses the optimized neural network to generate buy and sell signals.
 - Backtesting and evaluation: Evaluated the agent's performance on historical stock data, visualizing trading decisions and profitability.

**Key Tools and Technologies:**

 - Python libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
 - Machine learning model: Neural network.
 - Optimization algorithm: Deep Evolution Strategy (DES).
 - Trading strategy: Automated buy and sell signals based on predicted stock movements.

**Impact:** This project provides a practical example of how to build an automated trading system using advanced machine learning techniques. It highlights the potential of DES for optimizing neural networks in financial applications and offers a framework for developing data-driven trading strategies.
